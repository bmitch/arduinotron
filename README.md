The goal of this project is to clone the behaviour of the Kork Monotron Delay.

- Ability to control the LFO.
- Ability to control the intensity of the frequency change.
- Ability to change from square to triangle wave.
- Ability to control the cutoff frequency.

If possible:
- Ability to control the delay (time and frequency).

Or whatever this project morphs into.
